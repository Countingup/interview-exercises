# Countingup Pairing Exercise

## Overview

Thank you for choosing to interview with Countingup for our Full Stack Developer role. We hope you find the experience interesting and rewarding.

Our technical interview takes the form of a two-part guided pairing exercise, where you will be expected to work with a member of our team to code a solution to the problems outlined below. There will then be a session of follow up questions, including a chance for you to ask us questions as well. Whilst the core problem to be solved is relatively trivial, the exercise is designed for you to showcase your current skills, as well as demonstrate how quickly you can learn something new.

## Exercise

You will be provided a PDF with detailed instructions on the exercise and interview process.
